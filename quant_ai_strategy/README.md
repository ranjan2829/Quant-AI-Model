# Quant AI Strategy for Indian Markets

This repository contains a comprehensive Quant AI Strategy for trading in Indian markets using live data. The strategy employs machine learning models to generate trading signals based on technical indicators and market data.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains historical market data for Indian indices and stocks
- **models/**: Trained machine learning models for signal generation
- **results/**: Backtesting results and performance metrics
- **validation/**: Strategy validation reports and visualizations
- **implementation/**: Implementation plan and architecture diagrams

## Key Components

1. **Data Collection**: Historical data for 6 major Indian indices and 15 stocks
2. **Strategy Development**: 
   - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
   - Technical indicator calculation
   - Machine learning model training (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks)
3. **Backtesting**: Comprehensive backtesting framework with performance metrics
4. **Validation**: Risk analysis, robustness assessment, and sector performance evaluation
5. **Implementation Plan**: Detailed system architecture and deployment roadmap

## Performance Highlights

The strategy has been backtested on historical data with promising results:
- Positive returns across multiple stocks and indices
- Strong risk-adjusted performance metrics
- Robustness across different market conditions

## Implementation Guide

The implementation plan provides a detailed roadmap for deploying the strategy in a live trading environment, including:
- System architecture design
- Data pipeline implementation
- Model deployment procedures
- Trading execution framework
- Monitoring and alerting system
- Risk management protocols
